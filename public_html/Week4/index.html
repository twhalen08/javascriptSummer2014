            The Event listener object also has information about the target
            Depending on the event target, different information is given,
            Window, document, other Dom Objects

            function hello(e) {
                    console.log(e.type);

            To remove an event listener you can use the removeEventListener function.  It works the same way as adding one.

            target.removeEventListener(type, function);

            Function hello(e) {
                    console.log(e);
            }

            Window.removeEventListener(“load”, hello);
